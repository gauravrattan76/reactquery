    const {isLoading, data, isError, error, isFetching} = useQuery({
        queryKey: ['super-heroes'],
        queryFn: fetchSuperheroes,
   cacheTime: 2000,
   refetchOnMount: true,   
      })


isfetching will be true if data isfetcyed


is laoding is onky true fir the first time and the it cahches data if dont speciy time for 5 mins

hence we se loader only for the first time.

useQuery({
  queryKey: ['super-heroes'],
  queryFn: fetchSuperheroes,
  staleTime: 0,
  cacheTime: 0,
  refetchOnMount: true,
  refetchOnWindowFocus: true,
})


staleTime: 0 → Data becomes stale immediately.

cacheTime: 0 → Data is garbage collected immediately after unused.

refetchOnMount: true → Refetch when component mounts if data is stale.

BUT if cache is already deleted (because cacheTime: 0), then no cached data exists.
