React Query-
______________________________________-


A library for fetching data in application.

State management libraries are not great for working with asynchronous or server state


Client state-

Persisted in your app memory and accessing or updating is synhronous



Server state -


Persisted remotely and required asynchronous api fetching

Challenges when we have to deal with caching, updating data in background, performance optimization.
