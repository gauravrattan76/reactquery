ðŸ§  How React Query uses cache and loaders
When you call useQuery, this happens:


Step	What happens
1	If cached data exists â†’ show old data immediately (fast UI, no loader).
2	Meanwhile in background â†’ start refetching if data is stale.
3	Once new data arrives â†’ update the screen quietly (soft update).
âœ… So, loader is skipped because cache is available.
âœ… User sees something instantly (good UX).
âœ… Meanwhile, new network request refreshes data in background (silent update).

ðŸ“¦ Key idea: isLoading vs isFetching

Concept	When it is true
isLoading	Only true during the very first load when there is no cache.
isFetching	true whenever a background refetch is happening, even if cache exists.
So:

isLoading: true â†’ Blank screen / loader.

isFetching: true â†’ Old data shown, but new data coming silently.

ðŸ“ˆ Real Flow (Timeline)

Copy
Edit
First time visiting page:
  - No cache â†’ isLoading: true â†’ Show loading spinner
  - Data fetched â†’ isLoading: false

Next time visiting page:
  - Cache exists â†’ isLoading: false (no loader)
  - Data stale â†’ isFetching: true â†’ Silent background refetch
  - New data arrives â†’ UI updates
ðŸ›  Example Code:
javascript
Copy
Edit
const { data, isLoading, isFetching } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['todos'],
  queryFn: fetchTodos,
  staleTime: 30000, // 30 seconds
});
Behavior:

First load â†’ isLoading: true âž” Show loading spinner.

After load, data is cached.

If user navigates away and returns within 30 seconds â†’
âž” isLoading: false, but isFetching may be true to refresh.

ðŸŽ¯ So simply:

Question	Answer
Why does React Query skip loader after first time?	Because it uses cached data immediately.
Does it still update the data?	Yes, it fetches fresh data in background using isFetching.
ðŸ“¢ Important Tip
If you want even more control, you can also use:

javascript
Copy
Edit
keepPreviousData: true
in useQuery â€” this makes sure that even when parameters change (like pagination), React Query shows old data instantly until new data comes.

âœ¨ Final Summary
âœ… Loader is only shown when no cache exists.
âœ… Cached data is immediately reused (no loader again).
âœ… New data is fetched in background (isFetching: true).
âœ… UI is updated silently when new data arrives.

Would you like me to also show a small visual React component ðŸŽ¨ that shows loader only at first, and "Background Fetching..." when isFetching happens? ðŸš€
Itâ€™s super cool to see it live! Want it? ðŸŽ¯âœ¨
